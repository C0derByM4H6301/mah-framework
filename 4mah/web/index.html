        Mah Framework 2022 is a Framework Type released on August 26th. It is software that I am constantly developing.
        ExectorProjecte is a project that I started with the experience I gained. It was made with the efforts of Hafiz (Yusuf Can) 
        and Sofi (I). While I was doing general coding, Hafiz supported the design and motivates me.
